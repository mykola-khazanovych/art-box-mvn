How to build this project with Maven (apesial thanks to https://github.com/maxim-grinchenko/)


Step - 1. Installed and Environment variables

# if you do not have Java installed, install the <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html">Java Software Development Kit (SDK)</a>

# download and setup <a href="https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi">apache-maven</a> 

# download and <a href="http://tomcat.apache.org/">setup tomcat servler container</a> 

# be sure that you've added all the paths to installed products /bin directories (jdk and maven) to your system PATH variable:

# open console (win + R, print cmd, enter, etc.):

try print "java" and press enter, try print "javac" and press enter — these ones should be recognised as commands,

 and input command "mvn -v", should also be output like:

		Apache Maven 3.3.3 (7994120775791599e205a5524ec3e0dfe41d4a06; 2015-04-22T17:27:37+05:30)
		Maven home: C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\apache-maven-3.3.3
		Java version: 1.7.0_75, vendor: Oracle Corporation
		Java home: C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.7.0_75\jre
		Default locale: en_US, platform encoding: Cp1252
		
You are now all set to use Apache Maven for your projects.


Step - 2. Add configs files

# add settings from file "tomcat-users.txt" in your %tomcat-home%\conf\tomcat-users.xml 

# add settings from file "server.txt" in your %tomcat-home%\conf\server.xml

Step - 3. Command line 

# open console in %tomcat-home%\bin\ and input command "startup.bat" or "catalina.bat run"

# open console in \workspace\%name_project%\ and input command "mvn tomcat7:deploy"
	Should be output "BUILD SUCCESS"
	
	
BASE COMMAND IN CONSOLE:
# to stop server
		- shutdown.bat or shortcut "Ctrl+C" 

# checking active profiles created by � pom.xml
		- mvn help:active-profiles

# deploy by profile
		- mvn tomcat7:deploy -PMentor
		
# delete all artefacts in the 'target' directory"
		- mvn clean
		
# delete and create new target directory with new war
		- mvn clean install

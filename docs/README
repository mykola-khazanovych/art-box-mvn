Hello friend!

How to build this project with Maven?

Quite simple. I think you already have JDK, Tomcat and Maven installed and ready-to-work. If not — follow simple guide and succeed:
https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi
http://tomcat.apache.org/

Please update your "tomcat-users.txt" in %tomcat-home%\conf\tomcat-users.xml 

with the following code:

<tomcat-users>

	<role rolename="manager-script" />
	<role rolename="manager-gui" />
	
	#you can deploy your project to server(tomcat) using this setting:
	<user username="deploy-api" password="deploy-api" roles="manager-script" />
	
	#you can enter the tomcat's manager's gui console as:
	<user username="manager" password="manager" roles="manager-gui" />

</tomcat-users>

Then open console and input command "catalina.bat run" in %tomcat-home%\bin\ directory.
(exmpl: run console in the directory E:\installs\programmng\apache-tomcat-8.5.14\bin and input command: catalina.bat run)

To deploy this project on Tomcat run command "mvn tomcat7:deploy" from project's root
directory.
(exmpl: run console in the directory E:\Programming\Eclipse\art-box-mvn and input command: mvn tomcat7:deploy

Should be output "BUILD SUCCESS"

	
BASE COMMANDS IN CONSOLE:

# to stop server
		- shutdown.bat or shortcut "Ctrl+C" 
# deploy with particular profile
		- mvn tomcat7:deploy -PMentor
		
# delete all artefacts in the 'target' directory"
		- mvn clean
		
# delete and create new target directory with new war
		- mvn clean install
